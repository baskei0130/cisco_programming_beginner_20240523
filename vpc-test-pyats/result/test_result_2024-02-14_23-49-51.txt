--- Step 1: Ping from PC to 10.0.0.1 ---
n9kv-3 Interface Status:
Ethernet1/64 - up
Ethernet1/63 - up
Ping Result:
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.0.0.1, timeout is 2 seconds:
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 7/7/7 ms

--- Step 2: Ethernet1/64 Down ---
n9kv-3 Interface Status:
Ethernet1/64 - down
Ethernet1/63 - up
Ping Result:
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.0.0.1, timeout is 2 seconds:
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 8/9/10 ms

--- Step 3: Ethernet1/64 Up, Ethernet1/63 Down ---
n9kv-3 Interface Status:
Ethernet1/64 - up
Ethernet1/63 - down
Ping Result:
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.0.0.1, timeout is 2 seconds:
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 5/6/10 ms

--- Step 4: Ethernet1/64 Down, Ethernet1/63 Down ---
n9kv-3 Interface Status:
Ethernet1/64 - down
Ethernet1/63 - down
Ping Result:
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.0.0.1, timeout is 2 seconds:
.....
Success rate is 0 percent (0/5)

--- Step 5: Ethernet1/64 Up, Ethernet1/63 Up ---
n9kv-3 Interface Status:
Ethernet1/64 - up
Ethernet1/63 - up
Ping Result:
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.0.0.1, timeout is 2 seconds:
